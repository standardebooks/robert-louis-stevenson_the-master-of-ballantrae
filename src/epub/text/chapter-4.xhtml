				<p epub:type="title">Persecutions Endured by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>You can guess on what part of his adventures the Colonel principally dwelled. Indeed, if we had heard it all, it is to be thought the current of this business had been wholly altered; but the pirate ship was very gently touched upon. Nor did I hear the Colonel to an end even of that which he was willing to disclose; for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, having for some while been plunged in a brown study, rose at last from his seat and (reminding the Colonel there were matters that he must attend to) bade me follow him immediately to the office.</p>
			<p>Once there, he sought no longer to dissemble his concern, walking to and fro in the room with a contorted face, and passing his hand repeatedly upon his brow.</p>
			<p>“We have some business,” he began at last; and there broke off, declared we must have wine, and sent for a magnum of the best. This was extremely foreign to his habitudes; and, what was still more so, when the wine had come, he gulped down one glass upon another like a man careless of appearances. But the drink steadied him.</p>
			<p>“You will scarce be surprised, Mackellar,” says he, “when I tell you that my brother⁠—whose safety we are all rejoiced to learn⁠—stands in some need of money.”</p>
			<p>I told him I had misdoubted as much; but the time was not very fortunate, as the stock was low.</p>
			<p>“Not mine,” said he. “There is the money for the mortgage.”</p>
			<p>I reminded him it was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry’s.</p>
			<p>“I will be answerable to my wife,” he cried violently.</p>
			<p>“And then,” said I, “there is the mortgage.”</p>
			<p>“I know,” said he; “it is on that I would consult you.”</p>
			<p>I showed him how unfortunate a time it was to divert this money from its destination; and how, by so doing, we must lose the profit of our past economies, and plunge back the estate into the mire. I even took the liberty to plead with him; and when he still opposed me with a shake of the head and a bitter dogged smile, my zeal quite carried me beyond my place. “This is midsummer madness,” cried I; “and I for one will be no party to it.”</p>
			<p>“You speak as though I did it for my pleasure,” says he. “But I have a child now; and, besides, I love order; and to say the honest truth, Mackellar, I had begun to take a pride in the estates.” He gloomed for a moment. “But what would you have?” he went on. “Nothing is mine, nothing. This day’s news has knocked the bottom out of my life. I have only the name and the shadow of things⁠—only the shadow; there is no substance in my rights.”</p>
			<p>“They will prove substantial enough before a court,” said I.</p>
			<p>He looked at me with a burning eye, and seemed to repress the word upon his lips; and I repented what I had said, for I saw that while he spoke of the estate he had still a side-thought to his marriage. And then, of a sudden, he twitched the letter from his pocket, where it lay all crumpled, smoothed it violently on the table, and read these words to me with a trembling tongue:⁠—“ ‘My dear Jacob’⁠—This is how he begins!” cries he⁠—“ ‘My dear Jacob, I once called you so, you may remember; and you have now done the business, and flung my heels as high as Criffel.’ What do you think of that, Mackellar,” says he, “from an only brother? I declare to God I liked him very well; I was always staunch to him; and this is how he writes! But I will not sit down under the imputation”⁠—walking to and fro⁠—“I am as good as he; I am a better man than he, I call on God to prove it! I cannot give him all the monstrous sum he asks; he knows the estate to be incompetent; but I will give him what I have, and it is more than he expects. I have borne all this too long. See what he writes further on; read it for yourself: ‘I know you are a niggardly dog.’ A niggardly dog! I niggardly? Is that true, Mackellar? You think it is?” I really thought he would have struck me at that. “O, you all think so! Well, you shall see, and he shall see, and God shall see. If I ruin the estate and go barefoot, I shall stuff this bloodsucker. Let him ask all⁠—all, and he shall have it! It is all his by rights. Ah!” he cried, “and I foresaw all this, and worse, when he would not let me go.” He poured out another glass of wine, and was about to carry it to his lips, when I made so bold to as lay a finger on his arm. He stopped a moment. “You are right,” said he, and flung glass and all in the fireplace. “Come, let us count the money.”</p>
			<p>I durst no longer oppose him; indeed, I was very much affected by the sight of so much disorder in a man usually so controlled; and we sat down together, counted the money, and made it up in packets for the greater ease of Colonel Burke, who was to be the bearer. This done, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry returned to the hall, where he and my old lord sat all night through with their guest.</p>
			<p>A little before dawn I was called and set out with the Colonel. He would scarce have liked a less responsible convoy, for he was a man who valued himself; nor could we afford him one more dignified, for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry must not appear with the free-traders. It was a very bitter morning of wind, and as we went down through the long shrubbery the Colonel held himself muffled in his cloak.</p>
			<p>“Sir,” said I, “this is a great sum of money that your friend requires. I must suppose his necessities to be very great.”</p>
			<p>“We must suppose so,” says he, I thought drily; but perhaps it was the cloak about his mouth.</p>
			<p>“I am only a servant of the family,” said I. “You may deal openly with me. I think we are likely to get little good by him?”</p>
			<p>“My dear man,” said the Colonel, “Ballantrae is a gentleman of the most eminent natural abilities, and a man that I admire, and that I revere, to the very ground he treads on.” And then he seemed to me to pause like one in a difficulty.</p>
			<p>“But for all that,” said I, “we are likely to get little good by him?”</p>
			<p>“Sure, and you can have it your own way, my dear man,” says the Colonel.</p>
			<p>By this time we had come to the side of the creek, where the boat awaited him. “Well,” said he, “I am sure I am very much your debtor for all your civility, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Whatever-your-name-is; and just as a last word, and since you show so much intelligent interest, I will mention a small circumstance that may be of use to the family. For I believe my friend omitted to mention that he has the largest pension on the Scots Fund of any refugee in Paris; and it’s the more disgraceful, sir,” cries the Colonel, warming, “because there’s not one dirty penny for myself.”</p>
			<p>He cocked his hat at me, as if I had been to blame for this partiality; then changed again into his usual swaggering civility, shook me by the hand, and set off down to the boat, with the money under his arms, and whistling as he went the pathetic air of “Shule Aroon.” It was the first time I had heard that tune; I was to hear it again, words and all, as you shall learn, but I remember how that little stave of it ran in my head after the free-traders had bade him “Wheesht, in the deil’s name,” and the grating of the oars had taken its place, and I stood and watched the dawn creeping on the sea, and the boat drawing away, and the lugger lying with her foresail backed awaiting it.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The gap made in our money was a sore embarrassment, and, among other consequences, it had this: that I must ride to Edinburgh, and there raise a new loan on very questionable terms to keep the old afloat; and was thus, for close upon three weeks, absent from the house of Durrisdeer.</p>
			<p>What passed in the interval I had none to tell me, but I found <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry, upon my return, much changed in her demeanour. The old talks with my lord for the most part pretermitted; a certain deprecation visible towards her husband, to whom I thought she addressed herself more often; and, for one thing, she was now greatly wrapped up in Miss Katharine. You would think the change was agreeable to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; no such matter! To the contrary, every circumstance of alteration was a stab to him; he read in each the avowal of her truant fancies. That constancy to the Master of which she was proud while she supposed him dead, she had to blush for now she knew he was alive, and these blushes were the hated spring of her new conduct. I am to conceal no truth; and I will here say plainly, I think this was the period in which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry showed the worst. He contained himself, indeed, in public; but there was a deep-seated irritation visible underneath. With me, from whom he had less concealment, he was often grossly unjust, and even for his wife he would sometimes have a sharp retort: perhaps when she had ruffled him with some unwonted kindness; perhaps upon no tangible occasion, the mere habitual tenor of the man’s annoyance bursting spontaneously forth. When he would thus forget himself (a thing so strangely out of keeping with the terms of their relation), there went a shock through the whole company, and the pair would look upon each other in a kind of pained amazement.</p>
			<p>All the time, too, while he was injuring himself by this defect of temper, he was hurting his position by a silence, of which I scarce know whether to say it was the child of generosity or pride. The free-traders came again and again, bringing messengers from the Master, and none departed empty-handed. I never durst reason with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; he gave what was asked of him in a kind of noble rage. Perhaps because he knew he was by nature inclining to the parsimonious, he took a backforemost pleasure in the recklessness with which he supplied his brother’s exigence. Perhaps the falsity of the position would have spurred a humbler man into the same excess. But the estate (if I may say so) groaned under it; our daily expenses were shorn lower and lower; the stables were emptied, all but four roadsters; servants were discharged, which raised a dreadful murmuring in the country, and heated up the old disfavour upon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; and at last the yearly visit to Edinburgh must be discontinued.</p>
			<p>This was in 1756. You are to suppose that for seven years this bloodsucker had been drawing the life’s blood from Durrisdeer, and that all this time my patron had held his peace. It was an effect of devilish malice in the Master that he addressed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry alone upon the matter of his demands, and there was never a word to my lord. The family had looked on, wondering at our economies. They had lamented, I have no doubt, that my patron had become so great a miser⁠—a fault always despicable, but in the young abhorrent, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry was not yet thirty years of age. Still, he had managed the business of Durrisdeer almost from a boy; and they bore with these changes in a silence as proud and bitter as his own, until the coping-stone of the Edinburgh visit.</p>
			<p>At this time I believe my patron and his wife were rarely together, save at meals. Immediately on the back of Colonel Burke’s announcement <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry made palpable advances; you might say she had laid a sort of timid court to her husband, different, indeed, from her former manner of unconcern and distance. I never had the heart to blame <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry because he recoiled from these advances; nor yet to censure the wife, when she was cut to the quick by their rejection. But the result was an entire estrangement, so that (as I say) they rarely spoke, except at meals. Even the matter of the Edinburgh visit was first broached at table, and it chanced that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry was that day ailing and querulous. She had no sooner understood her husband’s meaning than the red flew in her face.</p>
			<p>“At last,” she cried, “this is too much! Heaven knows what pleasure I have in my life, that I should be denied my only consolation. These shameful proclivities must be trod down; we are already a mark and an eyesore in the neighbourhood. I will not endure this fresh insanity.”</p>
			<p>“I cannot afford it,” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“Afford?” she cried. “For shame! But I have money of my own.”</p>
			<p>“That is all mine, madam, by marriage,” he snarled, and instantly left the room.</p>
			<p>My old lord threw up his hands to Heaven, and he and his daughter, withdrawing to the chimney, gave me a broad hint to be gone. I found <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry in his usual retreat, the steward’s room, perched on the end of the table, and plunging his penknife in it with a very ugly countenance.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry,” said I, “you do yourself too much injustice, and it is time this should cease.”</p>
			<p>“O!” cries he, “nobody minds here. They think it only natural. I have shameful proclivities. I am a niggardly dog,” and he drove his knife up to the hilt. “But I will show that fellow,” he cried with an oath, “I will show him which is the more generous.”</p>
			<p>“This is no generosity,” said I; “this is only pride.”</p>
			<p>“Do you think I want morality?” he asked.</p>
			<p>I thought he wanted help, and I should give it him, willy-nilly; and no sooner was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry gone to her room than I presented myself at her door and sought admittance.</p>
			<p>She openly showed her wonder. “What do you want with me, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar?” said she.</p>
			<p>“The Lord knows, madam,” says I, “I have never troubled you before with any freedoms; but this thing lies too hard upon my conscience, and it will out. Is it possible that two people can be so blind as you and my lord? and have lived all these years with a noble gentleman like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, and understand so little of his nature?”</p>
			<p>“What does this mean?” she cried.</p>
			<p>“Do you not know where his money goes to? his⁠—and yours⁠—and the money for the very wine he does not drink at table?” I went on. “To Paris⁠—to that man! Eight thousand pounds has he had of us in seven years, and my patron fool enough to keep it secret!”</p>
			<p>“Eight thousand pounds!” she repeated. “It is impossible; the estate is not sufficient.”</p>
			<p>“God knows how we have sweated farthings to produce it,” said I. “But eight thousand and sixty is the sum, beside odd shillings. And if you can think my patron miserly after that, this shall be my last interference.”</p>
			<p>“You need say no more, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar,” said she. “You have done most properly in what you too modestly call your interference. I am much to blame; you must think me indeed a very unobservant wife” (looking upon me with a strange smile), “but I shall put this right at once. The Master was always of a very thoughtless nature; but his heart is excellent; he is the soul of generosity. I shall write to him myself. You cannot think how you have pained me by this communication.”</p>
			<p>“Indeed, madam, I had hoped to have pleased you,” said I, for I raged to see her still thinking of the Master.</p>
			<p>“And pleased,” said she, “and pleased me of course.”</p>
			<p>That same day (I will not say but what I watched) I had the satisfaction to see <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry come from his wife’s room in a state most unlike himself; for his face was all bloated with weeping, and yet he seemed to me to walk upon the air. By this, I was sure his wife had made him full amends for once. “Ah,” thought I to myself, “I have done a brave stroke this day.”</p>
			<p>On the morrow, as I was seated at my books, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry came in softly behind me, took me by the shoulders and shook me in a manner of playfulness. “I find you are a faithless fellow after all,” says he, which was his only reference to my part; but the tone he spoke in was more to me than any eloquence of protestation. Nor was this all I had effected; for when the next messenger came (as he did, not long afterwards) from the Master, he got nothing away with him but a letter. For some while back it had been I myself who had conducted these affairs; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry not setting pen to paper, and I only in the driest and most formal terms. But this letter I did not even see; it would scarce be pleasant reading, for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry felt he had his wife behind him for once, and I observed, on the day it was despatched, he had a very gratified expression.</p>
			<p>Things went better now in the family, though it could scarce be pretended they went well. There was now at least no misconception; there was kindness upon all sides; and I believe my patron and his wife might again have drawn together if he could but have pocketed his pride, and she forgot (what was the ground of all) her brooding on another man. It is wonderful how a private thought leaks out; it is wonderful to me now how we should all have followed the current of her sentiments; and though she bore herself quietly, and had a very even disposition, yet we should have known whenever her fancy ran to Paris. And would not anyone have thought that my disclosure must have rooted up that idol? I think there is the devil in women: all these years passed, never a sight of the man, little enough kindness to remember (by all accounts) even while she had him, the notion of his death intervening, his heartless rapacity laid bare to her; that all should not do, and she must still keep the best place in her heart for this accursed fellow, is a thing to make a plain man rage. I had never much natural sympathy for the passion of love; but this unreason in my patron’s wife disgusted me outright with the whole matter. I remember checking a maid because she sang some bairnly kickshaw while my mind was thus engaged; and my asperity brought about my ears the enmity of all the petticoats about the house; of which I recked very little, but it amused <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, who rallied me much upon our joint unpopularity. It is strange enough (for my own mother was certainly one of the salt of the earth, and my Aunt Dickson, who paid my fees at the University, a very notable woman), but I have never had much toleration for the female sex, possibly not much understanding; and being far from a bold man, I have ever shunned their company. Not only do I see no cause to regret this diffidence in myself, but have invariably remarked the most unhappy consequences follow those who were less wise. So much I thought proper to set down, lest I show myself unjust to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry. And, besides, the remark arose naturally, on a re-perusal of the letter which was the next step in these affairs, and reached me, to my sincere astonishment, by a private hand, some week or so after the departure of the last messenger.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<header>
					<p>Letter from Colonel Burke (afterwards Chevalier) to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar.</p>
					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Troyes in Champagne,<br/>
					<time datetime="1756-07-12">July 12, 1756</time>.</p>
				</header>
				<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dear Sir</span>⁠—You will doubtless be surprised to receive a communication from one so little known to you; but on the occasion I had the good fortune to rencounter you at Durrisdeer, I remarked you for a young man of a solid gravity of character: a qualification which I profess I admire and revere next to natural genius or the bold chivalrous spirit of the soldier. I was, besides, interested in the noble family which you have the honour to serve, or (to speak more by the book) to be the humble and respected friend of; and a conversation I had the pleasure to have with you very early in the morning has remained much upon my mind.</p>
				<p>Being the other day in Paris, on a visit from this famous city, where I am in garrison, I took occasion to inquire your name (which I profess I had forgot) at my friend, the Master of <abbr>B.</abbr>; and, a fair opportunity occurring, I write to inform you of what’s new.</p>
				<p>The Master of <abbr>B.</abbr> (when we had last some talk of him together) was in receipt, as I think I then told you, of a highly advantageous pension on the Scots Fund. He next received a company, and was soon after advanced to a regiment of his own. My dear sir, I do not offer to explain this circumstance; any more than why I myself, who have rid at the right hand of Princes, should be fubbed off with a pair of colours and sent to rot in a hole at the bottom of the province. Accustomed as I am to Courts, I cannot but feel it is no atmosphere for a plain soldier; and I could never hope to advance by similar means, even could I stoop to the endeavour. But our friend has a particular aptitude to succeed by the means of ladies; and if all be true that I have heard, he enjoyed a remarkable protection. It is like this turned against him; for when I had the honour to shake him by the hand, he was but newly released from the Bastille, where he had been cast on a sealed letter; and, though now released, has both lost his regiment and his pension. My dear sir, the loyalty of a plain Irishman will ultimately succeed in the place of craft; as I am sure a gentleman of your probity will agree.</p>
				<p>Now, sir, the Master is a man whose genius I admire beyond expression, and, besides, he is my friend; but I thought a little word of this revolution in his fortunes would not come amiss, for, in my opinion, the man’s desperate. He spoke, when I saw him, of an adventure upon India (whither I am myself in some hope of accompanying my illustrious countryman, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lally); but for this he would require (as I understood) more money than was readily at his command. You may have heard a military proverb: that it is a good thing to make a bridge of gold to a flying enemy? I trust you will take my meaning, and I subscribe myself, with proper respects to my Lord Durrisdeer, to his son, and to the beauteous <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Durie,</p>

			</blockquote>
			<p>This missive I carried at once to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; and I think there was but the one thought between the two of us: that it had come a week too late. I made haste to send an answer to Colonel Burke, in which I begged him, if he should see the Master, to assure him his next messenger would be attended to. But with all my haste I was not in time to avert what was impending: the arrow had been drawn; it must now fly. I could almost doubt the power of Providence (and certainly His will) to stay the issue of events; and it is a strange thought, how many of us had been storing up the elements of this catastrophe, for how long a time, and with how blind an ignorance of what we did.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>From the coming of the Colonel’s letter, I had a spyglass in my room, began to drop questions to the tenant folk, and as there was no great secrecy observed, and the free-trade (in our part) went by force as much as stealth, I had soon got together a knowledge of the signals in use, and knew pretty well to an hour when any messenger might be expected. I say, I questioned the tenants; for with the traders themselves, desperate blades that went habitually armed, I could never bring myself to meddle willingly. Indeed, by what proved in the sequel an unhappy chance, I was an object of scorn to some of these braggadocios; who had not only gratified me with a nickname, but catching me one night upon a bypath, and being all (as they would have said) somewhat merry, had caused me to dance for their diversion. The method employed was that of cruelly chipping at my toes with naked cutlasses, shouting at the same time “Square-toes”; and though they did me no bodily mischief, I was none the less deplorably affected, and was indeed for several days confined to my bed: a scandal on the state of Scotland on which no comment is required.</p>
			<p>It happened on the afternoon of November 7th, in this same unfortunate year, that I espied, during my walk, the smoke of a beacon fire upon the Muckleross. It was drawing near time for my return; but the uneasiness upon my spirits was that day so great that I must burst through the thickets to the edge of what they call the Craig Head. The sun was already down, but there was still a broad light in the west, which showed me some of the smugglers treading out their signal fire upon the Ross, and in the bay the lugger lying with her sails brailed up. She was plainly but new come to anchor, and yet the skiff was already lowered and pulling for the landing-place at the end of the long shrubbery. And this I knew could signify but one thing⁠—the coming of a messenger for Durrisdeer.</p>
			<p>I laid aside the remainder of my terrors, clambered down the brae⁠—a place I had never ventured through before⁠—and was hid among the shore-side thickets in time to see the boat touch. Captain Crail himself was steering, a thing not usual; by his side there sat a passenger; and the men gave way with difficulty, being hampered with near upon half a dozen portmanteaus, great and small. But the business of landing was briskly carried through; and presently the baggage was all tumbled on shore, the boat on its return voyage to the lugger, and the passenger standing alone upon the point of rock, a tall slender figure of a gentleman, habited in black, with a sword by his side and a walking-cane upon his wrist. As he so stood, he waved the cane to Captain Crail by way of salutation, with something both of grace and mockery that wrote the gesture deeply on my mind.</p>
			<p>No sooner was the boat away with my sworn enemies than I took a sort of half courage, came forth to the margin of the thicket, and there halted again, my mind being greatly pulled about between natural diffidence and a dark foreboding of the truth. Indeed, I might have stood there swithering all night, had not the stranger turned, spied me through the mists, which were beginning to fall, and waved and cried on me to draw near. I did so with a heart like lead.</p>
			<p>“Here, my good man,” said he, in the English accent, “here are some things for Durrisdeer.”</p>
			<p>I was now near enough to see him, a very handsome figure and countenance, swarthy, lean, long, with a quick, alert, black look, as of one who was a fighter, and accustomed to command; upon one cheek he had a mole, not unbecoming; a large diamond sparkled on his hand; his clothes, although of the one hue, were of a French and foppish design; his ruffles, which he wore longer than common, of exquisite lace; and I wondered the more to see him in such a guise when he was but newly landed from a dirty smuggling lugger. At the same time he had a better look at me, toised me a second time sharply, and then smiled.</p>
			<p>“I wager, my friend,” says he, “that I know both your name and your nickname. I divined these very clothes upon your hand of writing, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar.”</p>
			<p>At these words I fell to shaking.</p>
			<p>“O,” says he, “you need not be afraid of me. I bear no malice for your tedious letters; and it is my purpose to employ you a good deal. You may call me <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally: it is the name I have assumed; or rather (since I am addressing so great a precisian) it is so I have curtailed my own. Come now, pick up that, and that”⁠—indicating two of the portmanteaus. “That will be as much as you are fit to bear, and the rest can very well wait. Come, lose no more time, if you please.”</p>
			<p>His tone was so cutting that I managed to do as he bid by a sort of instinct, my mind being all the time quite lost. No sooner had I picked up the portmanteaus than he turned his back and marched off through the long shrubbery, where it began already to be dusk, for the wood is thick and evergreen. I followed behind, loaded almost to the dust, though I profess I was not conscious of the burden; being swallowed up in the monstrosity of this return, and my mind flying like a weaver’s shuttle.</p>
			<p>On a sudden I set the portmanteaus to the ground and halted. He turned and looked back at me.</p>
			<p>“Well?” said he.</p>
			<p>“You are the Master of Ballantrae?”</p>
			<p>“You will do me the justice to observe,” says he, “that I have made no secret with the astute Mackellar.”</p>
			<p>“And in the name of God,” cries I, “what brings you here? Go back, while it is yet time.”</p>
			<p>“I thank you,” said he. “Your master has chosen this way, and not I; but since he has made the choice, he (and you also) must abide by the result.⁠—And now pick up these things of mine, which you have set down in a very boggy place, and attend to that which I have made your business.”</p>
			<p>But I had no thought now of obedience; I came straight up to him. “If nothing will move you to go back,” said I; “though, sure, under all the circumstances, any Christian, or even any gentleman, would scruple to go forward.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“These are gratifying expressions,” he threw in.</p>
			<p>“If nothing will move you to go back,” I continued, “there are still some decencies to be observed. Wait here with your baggage, and I will go forward and prepare your family. Your father is an old man; and.⁠ ⁠…” I stumbled⁠ ⁠… “there are decencies to be observed.”</p>
			<p>“Truly,” said he, “this Mackellar improves upon acquaintance. But look you here, my man, and understand it once for all⁠—you waste your breath upon me, and I go my own way with inevitable motion.”</p>
			<p>“Ah!” says I. “Is that so? We shall see then!”</p>
			<p>And I turned and took to my heels for Durrisdeer. He clutched at me, and cried out angrily, and then I believe I heard him laugh, and then I am certain he pursued me for a step or two, and (I suppose) desisted. One thing at least is sure, that I came but a few minutes later to the door of the great house, nearly strangled for the lack of breath, but quite alone. Straight up the stair I ran, and burst into the hall, and stopped before the family without the power of speech; but I must have carried my story in my looks, for they rose out of their places and stared on me like changelings.</p>
			<p>“He has come,” I panted out at last.</p>
			<p>“He?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“Himself,” said I.</p>
			<p>“My son?” cried my lord. “Imprudent, imprudent boy! O, could he not stay where he was safe!”</p>
			<p>Never a word says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry; nor did I look at her, I scarce knew why.</p>
			<p>“Well,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, with a very deep breath, “and where is he?”</p>
			<p>“I left him in the long shrubbery,” said I.</p>
			<p>“Take me to him,” said he.</p>
			<p>So we went out together, he and I, without another word from anyone; and in the midst of the gravelled plot encountered the Master strolling up, whistling as he came, and beating the air with his cane. There was still light enough overhead to recognise, though not to read, a countenance.</p>
			<p>“Ah! Jacob,” says the Master. “So here is Esau back.”</p>
			<p>“James,” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, “for God’s sake, call me by my name. I will not pretend that I am glad to see you; but I would fain make you as welcome as I can in the house of our fathers.”</p>
			<p>“Or in <em>my</em> house? or <em>yours</em>?” says the Master. “Which were you about to say? But this is an old sore, and we need not rub it. If you would not share with me in Paris, I hope you will yet scarce deny your elder brother a corner of the fire at Durrisdeer?”</p>
			<p>“That is very idle speech,” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “And you understand the power of your position excellently well.”</p>
			<p>“Why, I believe I do,” said the other, with a little laugh. And this, though they had never touched hands, was (as we may say) the end of the brothers’ meeting; for at this the Master turned to me and bade me fetch his baggage.</p>
			<p>I, on my side, turned to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry for a confirmation; perhaps with some defiance.</p>
			<p>“As long as the Master is here, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar, you will very much oblige me by regarding his wishes as you would my own,” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “We are constantly troubling you: will you be so good as send one of the servants?”⁠—with an accent on the word.</p>
			<p>If this speech were anything at all, it was surely a well-deserved reproof upon the stranger; and yet, so devilish was his impudence, he twisted it the other way.</p>
			<p>“And shall we be common enough to say ‘Sneck up’?” inquires he softly, looking upon me sideways.</p>
			<p>Had a kingdom depended on the act, I could not have trusted myself in words; even to call a servant was beyond me; I had rather serve the man myself than speak; and I turned away in silence and went into the long shrubbery, with a heart full of anger and despair. It was dark under the trees, and I walked before me and forgot what business I was come upon, till I nearly broke my shin on the portmanteaus. Then it was that I remarked a strange particular; for whereas I had before carried both and scarce observed it, it was now as much as I could do to manage one. And this, as it forced me to make two journeys, kept me the longer from the hall.</p>
			<p>When I got there, the business of welcome was over long ago; the company was already at supper; and, by an oversight that cut me to the quick, my place had been forgotten. I had seen one side of the Master’s return; now I was to see the other. It was he who first remarked my coming in and standing back (as I did) in some annoyance. He jumped from his seat.</p>
			<p>“And if I have not got the good Mackellar’s place!” cries he. “John, lay another for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally; I protest he will disturb no one, and your table is big enough for all.”</p>
			<p>I could scarce credit my ears, nor yet my senses, when he took me by the shoulders and thrust me, laughing, into my own place⁠—such an affectionate playfulness was in his voice. And while John laid the fresh place for him (a thing on which he still insisted), he went and leaned on his father’s chair and looked down upon him, and the old man turned about and looked upwards on his son, with such a pleasant mutual tenderness that I could have carried my hand to my head in mere amazement.</p>
			<p>Yet all was of a piece. Never a harsh word fell from him, never a sneer showed upon his lip. He had laid aside even his cutting English accent, and spoke with the kindly Scots tongue, that set a value on affectionate words; and though his manners had a graceful elegance mighty foreign to our ways in Durrisdeer, it was still a homely courtliness, that did not shame but flattered us. All that he did throughout the meal, indeed, drinking wine with me with a notable respect, turning about for a pleasant word with John, fondling his father’s hand, breaking into little merry tales of his adventures, calling up the past with happy reference⁠—all he did was so becoming, and himself so handsome, that I could scarce wonder if my lord and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry sat about the board with radiant faces, or if John waited behind with dropping tears.</p>
			<p>As soon as supper was over, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry rose to withdraw.</p>
			<p>“This was never your way, Alison,” said he.</p>
			<p>“It is my way now,” she replied: which was notoriously false, “and I will give you a good night, James, and a welcome⁠—from the dead,” said she, and her voice dropped and trembled.</p>
			<p>Poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, who had made rather a heavy figure through the meal, was more concerned than ever; pleased to see his wife withdraw, and yet half displeased, as he thought upon the cause of it; and the next moment altogether dashed by the fervour of her speech.</p>
			<p>On my part, I thought I was now one too many; and was stealing after <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry, when the Master saw me.</p>
			<p>“Now, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar,” says he, “I take this near on an unfriendliness. I cannot have you go: this is to make a stranger of the prodigal son; and let me remind you where⁠—in his own father’s house! Come, sit ye down, and drink another glass with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally.”</p>
			<p>“Ay, ay, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar,” says my lord, “we must not make a stranger either of him or you. I have been telling my son,” he added, his voice brightening as usual on the word, “how much we valued all your friendly service.”</p>
			<p>So I sat there, silent, till my usual hour; and might have been almost deceived in the man’s nature but for one passage, in which his perfidy appeared too plain. Here was the passage; of which, after what he knows of the brothers’ meeting, the reader shall consider for himself. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry sitting somewhat dully, in spite of his best endeavours to carry things before my lord, up jumps the Master, passes about the board, and claps his brother on the shoulder.</p>
			<p>“Come, come, <em>Hairry lad</em>,” says he, with a broad accent, such as they must have used together when they were boys, “you must not be downcast because your brother has come home. All’s yours, that’s sure enough, and little I grudge it you. Neither must you grudge me my place beside my father’s fire.”</p>
			<p>“And that is too true, Henry,” says my old lord, with a little frown, a thing rare with him. “You have been the elder brother of the parable in the good sense; you must be careful of the other.”</p>
			<p>“I am easily put in the wrong,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“Who puts you in the wrong?” cried my lord, I thought very tartly for so mild a man. “You have earned my gratitude and your brother’s many thousand times: you may count on its endurance; and let that suffice.”</p>
			<p>“Ay, Harry, that you may,” said the Master; and I thought <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry looked at him with a kind of wildness in his eye.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>On all the miserable business that now followed, I have four questions that I asked myself often at the time, and ask myself still:⁠—Was the man moved by a particular sentiment against <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry? or by what he thought to be his interest? or by a mere delight in cruelty such as cats display and theologians tell us of the devil? or by what he would have called love? My common opinion halts among the three first; but perhaps there lay at the spring of his behaviour an element of all. As thus:⁠—Animosity to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry would explain his hateful usage of him when they were alone; the interests he came to serve would explain his very different attitude before my lord; that and some spice of a design of gallantry, his care to stand well with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry; and the pleasure of malice for itself, the pains he was continually at to mingle and oppose these lines of conduct.</p>
			<p>Partly because I was a very open friend to my patron, partly because in my letters to Paris I had often given myself some freedom of remonstrance, I was included in his diabolical amusement. When I was alone with him, he pursued me with sneers; before the family he used me with the extreme of friendly condescension. This was not only painful in itself; not only did it put me continually in the wrong; but there was in it an element of insult indescribable. That he should thus leave me out in his dissimulation, as though even my testimony were too despicable to be considered, galled me to the blood. But what it was to me is not worth notice. I make but memorandum of it here; and chiefly for this reason, that it had one good result, and gave me the quicker sense of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry’s martyrdom.</p>
			<p>It was on him the burden fell. How was he to respond to the public advances of one who never lost a chance of gibing him in private? How was he to smile back on the deceiver and the insulter? He was condemned to seem ungracious. He was condemned to silence. Had he been less proud, had he spoken, who would have credited the truth? The acted calumny had done its work; my lord and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry were the daily witnesses of what went on; they could have sworn in court that the Master was a model of long-suffering good-nature, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry a pattern of jealousy and thanklessness. And ugly enough as these must have appeared in anyone, they seemed tenfold uglier in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; for who could forget that the Master lay in peril of his life, and that he had already lost his mistress, his title, and his fortune?</p>
			<p>“Henry, will you ride with me?” asks the Master one day.</p>
			<p>And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, who had been goaded by the man all morning, raps out: “I will not.”</p>
			<p>“I sometimes wish you would be kinder, Henry,” says the other wistfully.</p>
			<p>I give this for a specimen; but such scenes befell continually. Small wonder if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry was blamed; small wonder if I fretted myself into something near upon a bilious fever; nay, and at the mere recollection feel a bitterness in my blood.</p>
			<p>Sure, never in this world was a more diabolical contrivance: so perfidious, so simple, so impossible to combat. And yet I think again, and I think always, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry might have read between the lines; she might have had more knowledge of her husband’s nature; after all these years of marriage she might have commanded or captured his confidence. And my old lord, too⁠—that very watchful gentleman⁠—where was all his observation? But, for one thing, the deceit was practised by a master hand, and might have gulled an angel. For another (in the case of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry), I have observed there are no persons so far away as those who are both married and estranged, so that they seem out of earshot, or to have no common tongue. For a third (in the case of both of these spectators), they were blinded by old ingrained predilection. And for a fourth, the risk the Master was supposed to stand in (supposed, I say⁠—you will soon hear why) made it seem the more ungenerous to criticise; and, keeping them in a perpetual tender solicitude about his life, blinded them the more effectually to his faults.</p>
			<p>It was during this time that I perceived most clearly the effect of manner, and was led to lament most deeply the plainness of my own. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry had the essence of a gentleman; when he was moved, when there was any call of circumstance, he could play his part with dignity and spirit; but in the day’s commerce (it is idle to deny it) he fell short of the ornamental. The Master (on the other hand) had never a movement but it commended him. So it befell that when the one appeared gracious and the other ungracious, every trick of their bodies seemed to call out confirmation. Not that alone: but the more deeply <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry floundered in his brother’s toils, the more clownish he grew; and the more the Master enjoyed his spiteful entertainment, the more engagingly, the more smilingly, he went! So that the plot, by its own scope and progress, furthered and confirmed itself.</p>
			<p>It was one of the man’s arts to use the peril in which (as I say) he was supposed to stand. He spoke of it to those who loved him with a gentle pleasantry, which made it the more touching. To <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry he used it as a cruel weapon of offence. I remember his laying his finger on the clean lozenge of the painted window one day when we three were alone together in the hall. “Here went your lucky guinea, Jacob,” said he. And when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry only looked upon him darkly, “O!” he added, “you need not look such impotent malice, my good fly. You can be rid of your spider when you please. How long, O Lord? When are you to be wrought to the point of a denunciation, scrupulous brother? It is one of my interests in this dreary hole. I ever loved experiment.” Still <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry only stared upon him with a glooming brow, and a changed colour; and at last the Master broke out in a laugh and clapped him on the shoulder, calling him a sulky dog. At this my patron leaped back with a gesture I thought very dangerous; and I must suppose the Master thought so too, for he looked the least in the world discountenanced, and I do not remember him again to have laid hands on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>But though he had his peril always on his lips in the one way or the other, I thought his conduct strangely incautious, and began to fancy the Government⁠—who had set a price upon his head⁠—was gone sound asleep. I will not deny I was tempted with the wish to denounce him; but two thoughts withheld me: one, that if he were thus to end his life upon an honourable scaffold, the man would be canonised for good in the minds of his father and my patron’s wife; the other, that if I was anyway mingled in the matter, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry himself would scarce escape some glancings of suspicion. And in the meanwhile our enemy went in and out more than I could have thought possible, the fact that he was home again was buzzed about all the countryside, and yet he was never stirred. Of all those so-many and so-different persons who were acquainted with his presence, none had the least greed⁠—as I used to say in my annoyance⁠—or the least loyalty; and the man rode here and there⁠—fully more welcome, considering the lees of old unpopularity, than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry⁠—and, considering the free-traders, far safer than myself.</p>
			<p>Not but what he had a trouble of his own; and this, as it brought about the gravest consequences, I must now relate. The reader will scarce have forgotten Jessie Broun; her way of life was much among the smuggling party; Captain Crail himself was of her intimates; and she had early word of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally’s presence at the house. In my opinion, she had long ceased to care two straws for the Master’s person; but it was become her habit to connect herself continually with the Master’s name; that was the ground of all her playacting; and so now, when he was back, she thought she owed it to herself to grow a haunter of the neighbourhood of Durrisdeer. The Master could scarce go abroad but she was there in wait for him; a scandalous figure of a woman, not often sober; hailing him wildly as “her bonny laddie,” quoting pedlar’s poetry, and, as I receive the story, even seeking to weep upon his neck. I own I rubbed my hands over this persecution; but the Master, who laid so much upon others, was himself the least patient of men. There were strange scenes enacted in the policies. Some say he took his cane to her, and Jessie fell back upon her former weapons⁠—stones. It is certain at least that he made a motion to Captain Crail to have the woman trepanned, and that the Captain refused the proposition with uncommon vehemence. And the end of the matter was victory for Jessie. Money was got together; an interview took place, in which my proud gentleman must consent to be kissed and wept upon; and the woman was set up in a public of her own, somewhere on Solway side (but I forget where), and, by the only news I ever had of it, extremely ill-frequented.</p>
			<p>This is to look forward. After Jessie had been but a little while upon his heels, the Master comes to me one day in the steward’s office, and with more civility than usual, “Mackellar,” says he, “there is a damned crazy wench comes about here. I cannot well move in the matter myself, which brings me to you. Be so good as to see to it: the men must have a strict injunction to drive the wench away.”</p>
			<p>“Sir,” said I, trembling a little, “you can do your own dirty errands for yourself.”</p>
			<p>He said not a word to that, and left the room.</p>
			<p>Presently came <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “Here is news!” cried he. “It seems all is not enough, and you must add to my wretchedness. It seems you have insulted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally.”</p>
			<p>“Under your kind favour, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry,” said I, “it was he that insulted me, and, as I think, grossly. But I may have been careless of your position when I spoke; and if you think so when you know all, my dear patron, you have but to say the word. For you I would obey in any point whatever, even to sin, God pardon me!” And thereupon I told him what had passed.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry smiled to himself; a grimmer smile I never witnessed. “You did exactly well,” said he. “He shall drink his Jessie Broun to the dregs.” And then, spying the Master outside, he opened the window, and, crying to him by the name of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally, asked him to step up and have a word.</p>
			<p>“James,” said he, when our persecutor had come in and closed the door behind him, looking at me with a smile, as if he thought I was to be humbled, “you brought me a complaint against <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar, into which I have inquired. I need not tell you I would always take his word against yours; for we are alone, and I am going to use something of your own freedom. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mackellar is a gentleman I value; and you must contrive, so long as you are under this roof, to bring yourself into no more collisions with one whom I will support at any possible cost to me or mine. As for the errand upon which you came to him, you must deliver yourself from the consequences of your own cruelty, and none of my servants shall be at all employed in such a case.”</p>
			<p>“My father’s servants, I believe,” said the Master.</p>
			<p>“Go to him with this tale,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>The Master grew very white. He pointed at me with his finger. “I want that man discharged,” he said.</p>
			<p>“He shall not be,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“You shall pay pretty dear for this,” says the Master.</p>
			<p>“I have paid so dear already for a wicked brother,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, “that I am bankrupt even of fears. You have no place left where you can strike me.”</p>
			<p>“I will show you about that,” says the Master, and went softly away.</p>
			<p>“What will he do next, Mackellar?” cries <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“Let me go away,” said I. “My dear patron, let me go away; I am but the beginning of fresh sorrows.”</p>
			<p>“Would you leave me quite alone?” said he.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>We were not long in suspense as to the nature of the new assault. Up to that hour the Master had played a very close game with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry; avoiding pointedly to be alone with her, which I took at the time for an effect of decency, but now think to have been a most insidious art; meeting her, you may say, at mealtime only; and behaving, when he did so, like an affectionate brother. Up to that hour, you may say he had scarce directly interfered between <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry and his wife; except in so far as he had manoeuvred the one quite forth from the good graces of the other. Now all that was to be changed; but whether really in revenge, or because he was wearying of Durrisdeer, and looked about for some diversion, who but the devil shall decide?</p>
			<p>From that hour, at least, began the siege of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry; a thing so deftly carried on that I scarce know if she was aware of it herself, and that her husband must look on in silence. The first parallel was opened (as was made to appear) by accident. The talk fell, as it did often, on the exiles in France; so it glided to the matter of their songs.</p>
			<p>“There is one,” says the Master, “if you are curious in these matters, that has always seemed to me very moving. The poetry is harsh: and yet, perhaps because of my situation, it has always found the way to my heart. It is supposed to be sung, I should tell you, by an exile’s sweetheart; and represents perhaps not so much the truth of what she is thinking, as the truth of what he hopes of her, poor soul! in these far lands.” And here the Master sighed. “I protest it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough Irish, all common sentinels, get to this song; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them. It goes thus, father,” says he, very adroitly taking my lord for his listener, “and if I cannot get to the end of it, you must think it is a common case with us exiles.” And thereupon he struck up the same air as I had heard the Colonel whistle; but now to words, rustic indeed, yet most pathetically setting forth a poor girl’s aspirations for an exiled lover; of which one verse indeed (or something like it) still sticks by me:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“O, I will dye my petticoat red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With my dear boy I’ll beg my bread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though all my friends should wish me dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Willie among the rushes, O!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He sang it well, even as a song; but he did better yet as a performer. I have heard famous actors, when there was not a dry eye in the Edinburgh theatre; a great wonder to behold; but no more wonderful than how the Master played upon that little ballad, and on those who heard him, like an instrument, and seemed now upon the point of failing, and now to conquer his distress, so that words and music seemed to pour out of his own heart and his own past, and to be aimed directly at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry. And his art went further yet; for all was so delicately touched, it seemed impossible to suspect him of the least design; and so far from making a parade of emotion, you would have sworn he was striving to be calm. When it came to an end, we all sat silent for a time; he had chosen the dusk of the afternoon, so that none could see his neighbour’s face; but it seemed as if we held our breathing; only my old lord cleared his throat. The first to move was the singer, who got to his feet suddenly and softly, and went and walked softly to and fro in the low end of the hall, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry’s customary place. We were to suppose that he there struggled down the last of his emotion; for he presently returned and launched into a disquisition on the nature of the Irish (always so much miscalled, and whom he defended) in his natural voice; so that, before the lights were brought, we were in the usual course of talk. But even then, methought <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry’s face was a shade pale; and, for another thing, she withdrew almost at once.</p>
			<p>The next sign was a friendship this insidious devil struck up with innocent Miss Katharine; so that they were always together, hand in hand, or she climbing on his knee, like a pair of children. Like all his diabolical acts, this cut in several ways. It was the last stroke to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, to see his own babe debauched against him; it made him harsh with the poor innocent, which brought him still a peg lower in his wife’s esteem; and (to conclude) it was a bond of union between the lady and the Master. Under this influence, their old reserve melted by daily stages. Presently there came walks in the long shrubbery, talks in the Belvedere, and I know not what tender familiarity. I am sure <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry was like many a good woman; she had a whole conscience, but perhaps by the means of a little winking. For even to so dull an observer as myself, it was plain her kindness was of a more moving nature than the sisterly. The tones of her voice appeared more numerous; she had a light and softness in her eye; she was more gentle with all of us, even with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, even with myself; methought she breathed of some quiet melancholy happiness.</p>
			<p>To look on at this, what a torment it was for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry! And yet it brought our ultimate deliverance, as I am soon to tell.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The purport of the Master’s stay was no more noble (gild it as they might) than to wring money out. He had some design of a fortune in the French Indies, as the Chevalier wrote me; and it was the sum required for this that he came seeking. For the rest of the family it spelled ruin; but my lord, in his incredible partiality, pushed ever for the granting. The family was now so narrowed down (indeed, there were no more of them than just the father and the two sons) that it was possible to break the entail and alienate a piece of land. And to this, at first by hints, and then by open pressure, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry was brought to consent. He never would have done so, I am very well assured, but for the weight of the distress under which he laboured. But for his passionate eagerness to see his brother gone, he would not thus have broken with his own sentiment and the traditions of his house. And even so, he sold them his consent at a dear rate, speaking for once openly, and holding the business up in its own shameful colours.</p>
			<p>“You will observe,” he said, “this is an injustice to my son, if ever I have one.”</p>
			<p>“But that you are not likely to have,” said my lord.</p>
			<p>“God knows!” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “And considering the cruel falseness of the position in which I stand to my brother, and that you, my lord, are my father, and have the right to command me, I set my hand to this paper. But one thing I will say first: I have been ungenerously pushed, and when next, my lord, you are tempted to compare your sons, I call on you to remember what I have done and what he has done. Acts are the fair test.”</p>
			<p>My lord was the most uneasy man I ever saw; even in his old face the blood came up. “I think this is not a very wisely chosen moment, Henry, for complaints,” said he. “This takes away from the merit of your generosity.”</p>
			<p>“Do not deceive yourself, my lord,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “This injustice is not done from generosity to him, but in obedience to yourself.”</p>
			<p>“Before strangers⁠ ⁠…” begins my lord, still more unhappily affected.</p>
			<p>“There is no one but Mackellar here,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry; “he is my friend. And, my lord, as you make him no stranger to your frequent blame, it were hard if I must keep him one to a thing so rare as my defence.”</p>
			<p>Almost I believe my lord would have rescinded his decision; but the Master was on the watch.</p>
			<p>“Ah! Henry, Henry,” says he, “you are the best of us still. Rugged and true! Ah! man, I wish I was as good.”</p>
			<p>And at that instance of his favourite’s generosity my lord desisted from his hesitation, and the deed was signed.</p>
			<p>As soon as it could be brought about, the land of Ochterhall was sold for much below its value, and the money paid over to our leech and sent by some private carriage into France. And now here was all the man’s business brought to a successful head, and his pockets once more bulging with our gold; and yet the point for which we had consented to this sacrifice was still denied us, and the visitor still lingered on at Durrisdeer. Whether in malice, or because the time was not yet come for his adventure to the Indies, or because he had hopes of his design on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry, or from the orders of the Government, who shall say? but linger he did, and that for weeks.</p>
			<p>You will observe I say: “from the orders of the Government”; for about this time the man’s disreputable secret trickled out.</p>
			<p>The first hint I had was from a tenant, who commented on the Master’s stay, and yet more on his security; for this tenant was a Jacobitish sympathiser, and had lost a son at Culloden, which gave him the more critical eye. “There is one thing,” said he, “that I cannot but think strange; and that is how he got to Cockermouth.”</p>
			<p>“To Cockermouth?” said I, with a sudden memory of my first wonder on beholding the man disembark so <i xml:lang="fr">point-de-vice</i> after so long a voyage.</p>
			<p>“Why, yes,” says the tenant, “it was there he was picked up by Captain Crail. You thought he had come from France by sea? And so we all did.”</p>
			<p>I turned this news a little in my head, and then carried it to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “Here is an odd circumstance,” said I, and told him.</p>
			<p>“What matters how he came, Mackellar, so long as he is here?” groans <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“No, sir,” said I, “but think again! Does not this smack a little of some Government connivance? You know how much we have wondered already at the man’s security.”</p>
			<p>“Stop,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “Let me think of this.” And as he thought, there came that grim smile upon his face that was a little like the Master’s. “Give me paper,” said he. And he sat without another word and wrote to a gentleman of his acquaintance⁠—I will name no unnecessary names, but he was one in a high place. This letter I despatched by the only hand I could depend upon in such a case⁠—Macconochie’s; and the old man rode hard, for he was back with the reply before even my eagerness had ventured to expect him. Again, as he read it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry had the same grim smile.</p>
			<p>“This is the best you have done for me yet, Mackellar,” says he. “With this in my hand I will give him a shog. Watch for us at dinner.”</p>
			<p>At dinner accordingly <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry proposed some very public appearance for the Master; and my lord, as he had hoped, objected to the danger of the course.</p>
			<p>“O!” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, very easily, “you need no longer keep this up with me. I am as much in the secret as yourself.”</p>
			<p>“In the secret?” says my lord. “What do you mean, Henry? I give you my word, I am in no secret from which you are excluded.”</p>
			<p>The Master had changed countenance, and I saw he was struck in a joint of his harness.</p>
			<p>“How?” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, turning to him with a huge appearance of surprise. “I see you serve your masters very faithfully; but I had thought you would have been humane enough to set your father’s mind at rest.”</p>
			<p>“What are you talking of? I refuse to have my business publicly discussed. I order this to cease,” cries the Master very foolishly and passionately, and indeed more like a child than a man.</p>
			<p>“So much discretion was not looked for at your hands, I can assure you,” continued <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry. “For see what my correspondent writes”⁠—unfolding the paper⁠—“ ‘It is, of course, in the interests both of the Government and the gentleman whom we may perhaps best continue to call <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally, to keep this understanding secret; but it was never meant his own family should continue to endure the suspense you paint so feelingly; and I am pleased mine should be the hand to set these fears at rest. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bally is as safe in Great Britain as yourself.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Is this possible?” cries my lord, looking at his son, with a great deal of wonder, and still more of suspicion in his face.</p>
			<p>“My dear father,” says the Master, already much recovered. “I am overjoyed that this may be disclosed. My own instructions, direct from London, bore a very contrary sense, and I was charged to keep the indulgence secret from everyone, yourself not excepted, and indeed yourself expressly named⁠—as I can show in black and white, unless I have destroyed the letter. They must have changed their mind very swiftly, for the whole matter is still quite fresh; or rather, Henry’s correspondent must have misconceived that part, as he seems to have misconceived the rest. To tell you the truth, sir,” he continued, getting visibly more easy, “I had supposed this unexplained favour to a rebel was the effect of some application from yourself; and the injunction to secrecy among my family the result of a desire on your part to conceal your kindness. Hence I was the more careful to obey orders. It remains now to guess by what other channel indulgence can have flowed on so notorious an offender as myself; for I do not think your son need defend himself from what seems hinted at in Henry’s letter. I have never yet heard of a Durrisdeer who was a turncoat or a spy,” says he proudly.</p>
			<p>And so it seemed he had swum out of this danger unharmed; but this was to reckon without a blunder he had made, and without the pertinacity of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, who was now to show he had something of his brother’s spirit.</p>
			<p>“You say the matter is still fresh?” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry.</p>
			<p>“It is recent,” says the Master, with a fair show of stoutness, and yet not without a quaver.</p>
			<p>“Is it so recent as that?” asks <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, like a man a little puzzled, and spreading his letter forth again.</p>
			<p>In all the letter there was no word as to the date; but how was the Master to know that?</p>
			<p>“It seemed to come late enough for me,” says he, with a laugh. And at the sound of that laugh, which rang false, like a cracked bell, my lord looked at him again across the table, and I saw his old lips draw together close.</p>
			<p>“No,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, still glancing on his letter, “but I remember your expression. You said it was very fresh.”</p>
			<p>And here we had a proof of our victory, and the strongest instance yet of my lord’s incredible indulgence; for what must he do but interfere to save his favourite from exposure!</p>
			<p>“I think, Henry,” says he, with a kind of pitiful eagerness, “I think we need dispute no more. We are all rejoiced at last to find your brother safe; we are all at one on that; and, as grateful subjects, we can do no less than drink to the King’s health and bounty.”</p>
			<p>Thus was the Master extricated; but at least he had been put to his defence, he had come lamely out, and the attraction of his personal danger was now publicly plucked away from him. My lord, in his heart of hearts, now knew his favourite to be a Government spy; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry (however she explained the tale) was notably cold in her behaviour to the discredited hero of romance. Thus in the best fabric of duplicity there is some weak point, if you can strike it, which will loosen all; and if, by this fortunate stroke, we had not shaken the idol, who can say how it might have gone with us at the catastrophe?</p>
			<p>And yet at the time we seemed to have accomplished nothing. Before a day or two he had wiped off the ill results of his discomfiture, and, to all appearance, stood as high as ever. As for my Lord Durrisdeer, he was sunk in parental partiality; it was not so much love, which should be an active quality, as an apathy and torpor of his other powers; and forgiveness (so to misapply a noble word) flowed from him in sheer weakness, like the tears of senility. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry’s was a different case; and Heaven alone knows what he found to say to her, or how he persuaded her from her contempt. It is one of the worst things of sentiment, that the voice grows to be more important than the words, and the speaker than that which is spoken. But some excuse the Master must have found, or perhaps he had even struck upon some art to wrest this exposure to his own advantage; for after a time of coldness, it seemed as if things went worse than ever between him and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry. They were then constantly together. I would not be thought to cast one shadow of blame, beyond what is due to a half-wilful blindness, on that unfortunate lady; but I do think, in these last days, she was playing very near the fire; and whether I be wrong or not in that, one thing is sure and quite sufficient: <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry thought so. The poor gentleman sat for days in my room, so great a picture of distress that I could never venture to address him; yet it is to be thought he found some comfort even in my presence and the knowledge of my sympathy. There were times, too, when we talked, and a strange manner of talk it was; there was never a person named, nor an individual circumstance referred to; yet we had the same matter in our minds, and we were each aware of it. It is a strange art that can thus be practised; to talk for hours of a thing, and never name nor yet so much as hint at it. And I remember I wondered if it was by some such natural skill that the Master made love to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry all day long (as he manifestly did), yet never startled her into reserve.</p>
			<p>To show how far affairs had gone with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry, I will give some words of his, uttered (as I have cause not to forget) upon the 26th of February 1757. It was unseasonable weather, a cast back into winter: windless, bitter cold, the world all white with rime, the sky low and grey: the sea black and silent like a quarry-hole. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry sat close by the fire, and debated (as was now common with him) whether “a man” should “do things,” whether “interference was wise,” and the like general propositions, which each of us particularly applied. I was by the window, looking out, when there passed below me the Master, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Henry, and Miss Katharine, that now constant trio. The child was running to and fro, delighted with the frost; the Master spoke close in the lady’s ear with what seemed (even from so far) a devilish grace of insinuation; and she on her part looked on the ground like a person lost in listening. I broke out of my reserve.</p>
			<p>“If I were you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Henry,” said I, “I would deal openly with my lord.”</p>
			<p>“Mackellar, Mackellar,” said he, “you do not see the weakness of my ground. I can carry no such base thoughts to anyone⁠—to my father least of all; that would be to fall into the bottom of his scorn. The weakness of my ground,” he continued, “lies in myself, that I am not one who engages love. I have their gratitude, they all tell me that; I have a rich estate of it! But I am not present in their minds; they are moved neither to think with me nor to think for me. There is my loss!” He got to his feet, and trod down the fire. “But some method must be found, Mackellar,” said he, looking at me suddenly over his shoulder; “some way must be found. I am a man of a great deal of patience⁠—far too much⁠—far too much. I begin to despise myself. And yet, sure, never was a man involved in such a toil!” He fell back to his brooding.</p>
			<p>“Cheer up,” said I. “It will burst of itself.”</p>
			<p>“I am far past anger now,” says he, which had so little coherency with my own observation that I let both fall.</p>
